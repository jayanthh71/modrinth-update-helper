# Overview

Do you ever come back to playing minecraft every major update, and need to update your mods not knowing whether they support the latest version or not?

Using this tool, you can:
- Search for a mod and verify its compatibility with a specific minecraft version.
- Create mod lists as text files to check compatibility of multiple mods at once.

# Dependencies

- This cli tool was built using [inquirer](https://github.com/magmax/python-inquirer) for Python.
- The [Modrinth Labrinth API](https://github.com/modrinth/labrinth) was used using the [requests](https://github.com/psf/requests) module.

# Running

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
